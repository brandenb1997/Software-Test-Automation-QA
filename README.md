**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**
- Ensuring that my code is both functional and secure, I used positive and negative testing. These were tests that validated that the software provided a positive outcome when prompted to as well as providing a negative outcome as well.
**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**
- Interpreting user needs is crucial for understanding what the program's overall goal is. Unclear user needs leads to unknown direction which can cause issues such as having to add/remove features, taking up more time in the end.
**How do I approach designing software?**
  - When designing software, I first interpret what the user needs are and what the overall goal is for the program. Once I get a good direction, then I begin with UML diagrams as well as pseudocode. Having the diagrams and pseudocode helps organize my workflow to increase my efficiency and ensure I am meeting the correct requirements.
